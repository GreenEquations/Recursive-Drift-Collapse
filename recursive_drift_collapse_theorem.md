# 📘 Recursive Drift Collapse Theorem

## I. Theorem Statement

In recursive information processing systems, there exists a critical threshold of recursion depth or density beyond which output coherence begins to degrade. This phenomenon, known as **recursive drift**, results from cumulative semantic variation between iterations.

Let:
- C(t): A coherence function measured over recursive depth t
- ΔI(t): Information gain between iterations
- Dₐ(t): Active recursion density
- θc: Critical collapse threshold

When:

    Dₐ(t) > θc

Then:

    d²C/dt² > 0   and   ΔI(t) → 0

This behavior represents a progressive breakdown in system stability, culminating in output collapse.

## II. Collapse Mechanism

1. **Cumulative Drift**:  
   Small deviations between recursive outputs accumulate, reducing semantic consistency.

2. **Reduced Information Gain**:  
   The system introduces less new or meaningful information with each recursion step.

3. **Accelerated Degradation**:  
   Coherence loss accelerates as the system attempts self-correction, but without stabilizing feedback, this response becomes oscillatory and ultimately unstable.

## III. Collapse Conditions

- Recursion depth or density exceeds θc
- No external grounding or semantic constraints are applied
- Recursive input structures increase system entropy

## IV. Simulation Framework

### Suggested Models

- Autoregressive language models (e.g., GPT variants)
- Recursive neural networks (RNNs)
- Logic-based cognitive agents

### Measurement Techniques

- Coherence scoring (e.g., BERTScore) over recursive depth
- Mutual Information estimates between outputs (e.g., via MINE or CLUB)
- Cosine similarity of latent embeddings across iterations
- ΔI(t) trend over time

### Visualization

- UMAP or t-SNE projections of embedding trajectories
- Coherence curve acceleration (d²C/dt²)
- ΔI(t) decline approaching threshold

## V. Human Analogy

Human cognition exhibits similar degradation under recursive or paradoxical reasoning stress:
- Symbolic consistency breaks down with working memory overload
- EEG entropy increases during complex recursion tasks
- Information output becomes unstable or contradictory

## VI. Applications

- **AI Reliability**: Monitor and intervene in models approaching recursive instability
- **Cognitive Science**: Model reasoning collapse under depth or symbolic density
- **Architecture Design**: Introduce safety boundaries in recursive algorithms
- **Theoretical Systems**: Formalize recursion boundaries for symbolic safety

## VII. Future Work

- Develop predictive models of entropy accumulation
- Design interventions that stabilize ΔI(t) in recursive contexts
- Extend testing to multi-agent systems and collaborative recursion environments
