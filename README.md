# 📘 Recursive Drift Collapse Theorem

## Overview

This repository introduces the **Recursive Drift Collapse Theorem**, which describes the progressive degradation of output coherence in recursive information systems. As recursion depth increases, small variations compound across iterations, leading to loss of semantic consistency, reduced information gain, and eventual output collapse.

This behavior has relevance in natural language models, logic engines, symbolic systems, and cognitive frameworks.

## Key Concepts

- **C(t)** – Coherence function over recursion depth
- **ΔI(t)** – Information gain between recursive iterations
- **Dₐ(t)** – Active recursion density
- **θc** – Critical recursion threshold beyond which output quality degrades

When recursion density exceeds θc:

    d²C/dt² > 0    and    ΔI(t) → 0

This marks a structural failure point in recursive processing.

## Observable Effects

- Declining mutual information between recursive outputs
- Semantic drift and symbolic inconsistency
- Output instability, hallucination, or contradiction
- Gradual acceleration of degradation, even with attempted self-correction

## Simulation Design

### Model Types

- Autoregressive transformers (e.g., GPT, LLaMA)
- Recursive neural networks (RNNs)
- Symbolic systems with looped inference chains

### Metrics

- BERTScore at each recursion step
- Mutual information across iterations
- Latent embedding drift (cosine similarity)
- ΔI(t) trend analysis

### Visualization Tools

- UMAP / t-SNE for latent embedding trajectories
- Coherence curvature plots
- Recursion threshold indicators

## Human Cognition Parallel

Recursive overload in human cognition presents similar patterns:
- Working memory limits breached in paradox chains
- EEG entropy increases under symbolic recursion load
- Symbolic drift and breakdown in consistent reasoning

## Applications

- **AI Safety** – Identify failure points in recursive model output
- **Cognitive Modeling** – Simulate reasoning collapse under recursive load
- **Symbolic Systems** – Define safe recursion boundaries
- **Tooling** – Design entropy-aware limits in generative AI
