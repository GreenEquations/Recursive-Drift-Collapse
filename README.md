Recursive Drift Collapse Theorem
Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Recursive Drift Collapse Theorem! This theorem addresses how recursive self-referential loops in symbolic systems (whether artificial or biological) lead to semantic collapse. As these systems process increasing recursion depth, they experience a drift in their logical structure, which can result in paradoxes, logical contradictions, and a catastrophic loss of coherence.

This work is highly relevant for AI safety, neuroscience, and cognitive science, as it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the collapse of symbolic reasoning systems under recursive load, with significant implications for the design of robust AI systems and cognitive overload in humans.

Key Concepts:
Symbolic Systems: Systems of symbols and rules that interact according to a logical or computational framework. This can include neural-symbolic hybrids, transformers, and human cognition.

Recursive Drift: The gradual degradation of semantic coherence as recursive cycles within the system exceed a critical threshold.

Coherence Function

Œ¶ 
r
‚Äã
 (t): A measure of semantic coherence or logical consistency of the system over time. It is used to track how well the system maintains coherence as recursion depth increases.

Recursion Density

D 
r
‚Äã
 (t): A measure of the density of recursive cycles occurring within the system at a given time, representing how much recursion the system is handling.

Information Gain

)
ŒîI(t): The rate at which the system produces novel meaningful outputs based on new inputs. When information gain stagnates, it signals collapse.

Testable Predictions:
AI Systems: Recursive cycles in transformers and neural-symbolic hybrids will lead to semantic drift and feedback saturation, measured by BERTScore, logit entropy, and embedding drift.

Model Performance: Performance degradation will occur in text generation, classification, or translation tasks as recursion density increases, causing the model to fail in producing meaningful output.

Human Cognition: Paradox chains (e.g., liar paradox, Grelling‚ÄìNelson paradox) will induce cognitive overload. Humans will experience logical contradictions, delays, and semantic incoherence as recursion density rises.

Physiological Indicators: Increased EEG entropy and pupil dilation will signal cognitive breakdown as recursion density increases, marking cognitive overload and logical collapse.

What We Need: Collaboration and Feedback
We invite AI researchers, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and others interested in the impact of recursive feedback and paradox-induced collapse to contribute to the testing, refining, and expanding of this theorem. Here‚Äôs how you can help:

Areas for Collaboration:
Theoretical Refinement:

How can we improve the mathematical framework for recursion density and coherence degradation?

Are there additional feedback mechanisms that should be included in the model?

Empirical Testing:

How can we empirically measure recursive collapse in transformer models and neural-symbolic hybrids?

Can we design tests to track cognitive overload in humans exposed to recursive paradoxes?

Applications to AI Safety:

What steps can we take to prevent recursive hallucinations and feedback collapse in AI systems?

How can we design error correction mechanisms for AI systems to manage recursive overload?

Cross-Disciplinary Contributions:

Can this model help us understand human cognitive overload in paradoxical reasoning or recursive thinking?

How can this model be applied to complex systems in other domains, such as social dynamics or economics?

Test Design:

Are there alternative tests or new approaches to validate the collapse condition and recursive feedback in both AI and human cognition?
